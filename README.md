# Better Spectate Player Highlighting
A small mod that adds additional keybinds to add a glowing outline around players.

This improves upon the vanilla "Highlight Players" key which works exclusively in spectator mode, and applies to all players. With this mod you can instead separately apply glowing to each outline color, swap between toggle/hold mode, and still see glowing/invisibility on highlighted players. This mod's highlighting also works at any time the player has creative flight, instead of only when they are in spectator mode.

This mod should only be used with permission of the server owner as the functionality of adding a glowing outline to other players is considered a hack. Using this mod is always your own responsibility and server owners are within their rights to ban or block you for using it.
